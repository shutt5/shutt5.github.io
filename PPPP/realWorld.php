<h2> So we've seen the problem... </h2>
  But what does it mean?

  The Dining Philosphers Problem is an interesting representation of a concurrency problem in Operating Systems.
  There are many different guises of the problem, for example

  <? include 'example.html' ?>

  <h2> But what does this mean for operating systems? </h2>

  In an operating systems situation we can think of the following:

  <ul>
    <li> Philosophers are processes</li>
    <li> Chopsticks are resources that the processes need, for example, certain files</li>
    <li> All processes need to run correctly</li>
 </ul>

These problems have parallels for operating systems.

 <ul>
    <li> Deadlock would mean nothing would run or processes would not complete </li>
    <li> Starvation would mean certain porcesses would never finish </li>
</ul>

Either of these conditions would result in the operating system failing to perform it's task.

So how do we solve it?

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-10"></div>
  <div class="col-md-2">
    <a href = "code.php"><button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">Next</button></a>
  </div>
