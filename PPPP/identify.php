<h2> Identifying Deadlock and Starvation Activity </h2>

Below we present a few real life examples of potential deadlock and starvation. For each example, please select whether you think it is a case of deadlock, starvation, or neither.<br/><br/>

<div class="outline">
<p id="pseudobox">
In airport security there are two lines: one for TSA pre-check and one for all other passengers.  TSA pre-check passengers go through security first.  Every time a pre-check passenger is taken through security, another one arrives in the pre-check line.  The other passengers wait and never get to go through security.  This is an example of:

</div>

<div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" onclick="showAnswer(1)">Starvation</button>
<div id="answer1" class="border" style="display: none">
<div class='border' style="background-color:#97cc04">
<b>Correct!</b> Since pre-check passengers are always given priority and there is always at least one pre-check passenger in line, regular passengers are never given the opportunity to move through the line.
</div>
</div>				   
</div>

<div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" onclick="showAnswer(2)">Deadlock</button>
<div id="answer2" class="border" style="display: none">
<div class='border' style="background-color:#f45d01">
<b>Incorrect.</b> Since pre-check passengers are always going through security, only one type of passenger is recieving service. An example of <b>Deadlock</b> in this case would be two unbelievably nice passengers, both a pre-check and regular. The pre-check sees a regular in line and offers for them to go first. Appreciative of the offer, the regular insists the pre-check go first, which the pre-check brushes off and again offers the regular go through security first. This back-and-forth exchange continues indefinitely.
</div>
</div>

<div>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary" onclick="showAnswer(3)">Neither</button>
<div id="answer3" class="border" style="display: none">
<div class='border' style="background-color:#f45d01">
<b>Incorrect.</b> Because there is a constant stream of pre-check passengers, and since pre-check passengers are given priority, regular passengers are unable to move through security.
